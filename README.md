# IBM-Data-Science-Capstone-SpaceX
This is the finished Applied Data Science Capstone Project from the last course of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate. This capstone project course will allow me to practice the work that data scientists conduct in the field while dealing with datasets.

In this course, I played the role of a Data Scientist working for a startup that aims to compete with SpaceX, and I followed the Data Science methodology, which included data collection, data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, model development, model evaluation, and reporting to stakeholders.

I was entrusted with forecasting whether the first stage of SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket would land successfully. My data Science discoveries and models enabled the rival firm I was employed by to make better informed bids against SpaceX for a rocket launch.

This course emphasized hands-on experience to illustrate and apply what I had learnt in earlier IBM Data Science courses.
